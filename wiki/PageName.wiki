#summary Benchmark comparisons with Avisynth 2.60 alpha 2.

== Benchmarks ==

All of the benchmarks were done using avs2avi, a program that reads an Avisynth script and then can output the resulting video and audio to any available video for windows compressor.  The original program (32 bit) can be found [http://moitah.net/download/latest/AVS2AVI.zip here.]  The program is open source, and was compiled for x64, enabling reading of 64 bit Avisynth scripts.  It is available [http://www.mediafire.com/?yykmkawa40j here.]

These benchmarks were done to a null output, meaning that the script was read and processed, but no data was written to disk.

Compression was not used in any of these tests.

All tests were conducted on an Intel Core i5-750 running at 3.71GHz with 4GB of ram.  All tests were conducted three times, averaging the results.  The input clip used was a 2000 frame DVSD capture in the YV12 color space. 

Avisynth 2.6 alpha 2 was used for the 32 bit benchmarks.  This was chosen because the code is stable for all input patterns used, and includes a variety of updates to enhance the speed of various internal processes.
