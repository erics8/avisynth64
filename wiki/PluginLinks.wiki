[http://www.mediafire.com/?i2qtli1mxik Built on 3/13/2010: Beta TIVTC x64]

[http://www.mediafire.com/?oemygnmkrji Built on 3/13/2010: DFTTest x64]
    * Needs the included libfftw3f-3.dll to be in your system32 directory

[http://www.mediafire.com/?kmcztm1xzjm Built on 3/14/2010: TDeint x64]
    * This is basically the same as squid80's build, main differences being newer avisynth.h and newer compiler

[http://www.mediafire.com/?tqmjdnjdnum Built on 3/14/2010: LeakKernelDeint x64]


[http://www.mediafire.com/?znmyzdo2ize Built on 4/10/2010: EEDI2 x64]
    * Vectorized main loop calculations
    * Further restructured main loop to minimize branching, processor dependent speed increase
    * EEDI2 uses a copy of Avisynth's BitBlt function (basically, a looping memory copy), finally wrote my own, compiled EEDI2 with it
    * If this build runs slower than [http://www.mediafire.com/?yrjx4ijzycz the older version] please let me know

[http://www.mediafire.com/?jqyziyme1zd Built on 3/12/2010: MaskTools 2.0a x64]


[http://www.mediafire.com/?2yjmze2ommz Built on 4/01/2010: MVTools2 x64]
    * Continued conversion and updating of assembly functions
    * Removal of some code intended to support processors without mmx/iSSE
    * Converted often used assembly functions to SSE2 instead of mmx/iSSE
    * Updated to latest shared function library from x264
    * Healthy 20%+ speed increase over x86 version in most cases


[http://www.mediafire.com/?2ymcyfuzzzw Built on 3/12/2010: FFT3DFilter]
    * Needs the included libfftw3f-3.dll to be in your system32 directory

[http://www.mediafire.com/?qjmyjt52miz RemoveGrain x64]

[http://www.mediafire.com/?q00r32yegnh Repair x64]

[http://www.mediafire.com/?2chnt1jkwwm Built on 3/15/2010: FFT3DGPU x64[/URL]
    * Note: This ones just because it's nice to have a 64bit FFT filter, since the bulk of the computation is on the GPU, I doubt there's much of a performance difference.
    * Note2: The hlsl (shader program) file is edited from the original to adhere to pixel shader 3.0 syntax rules.  Please make sure to place the correct file in the same directory as the 64bit plugin.
